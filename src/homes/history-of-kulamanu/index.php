            <i class = 'caption'>Street façade</i>
            <h2 class = 'page-section'>Background</h2>
            <p class = 'page-section'>This property was originally purchased as an empty lot by the owner's grandmother, Alice, in 1957. She chose it because
  it was the highest on the street and had the greatest exposure to the island’s pleasant trade winds on the west side of
  Black Point. It took Alice six years to build her home, and its quaint character remained unchanged for more than five
  decades.</p>
            <p class = 'page-section'>In 1996, its current owner purchased the house and rented it for 15 years, during which it slowly deteriorated, leaving it
  in desperate need of repairs and updates when it was vacated. Living in Los Angeles at the time, his first impulse was
  to sell the property as-is as a tear down and walk away. That didn’t sit well, however, because even though many years
  had passed since it was a setting for warm childhood memories, a sentimental connection still existed. So, using the
  good bones it still possessed as a base, he set about giving it new life. It became the underlay for one of Kahala's most
  luxurious estates, while paying homage to his grandmother's memory, and her love for island breezes and ocean views.</p>
            <p class = 'page-section'>He contracted Carlos Ferreira, principal of Sketchtank Interior Design and Architecture, based in Los Angeles, to create
  a new identity for the home. Sketchtank is a firm he has a long-standing relationship with, having hired them previously
  to design his Cuban restaurant and live music venue in Los Angeles, as well as update the facade of a 1940's commercial
  property in downtown Long Beach which was originally a Lehmans Department Store. Besides their collaborating
  history on commercial projects, Sketchtank's experience in high-end celebrity homes factored highly in his decision.
  Hawaii Architects, Inc. a local and respected firm also experienced in high end homes, were the engineers and architect
  of record.</p>
            <p class = 'page-section'>The original direction involved a mere update, maintaining the original silhouette and floor plan, but after researching surrounding premium homes, a more ambitious transformation was pursued. Sketchtank gutted
  the original floor plan to the footings, while adding a second floor master suite with expansive ocean sunset and
  Diamond Head views, overhanging a new pool, a private guest suite over a 3 car garage and layered landscaping
  with dramatic water features.</p>
            <p class = 'page-section'>Whereas many luxury homes focus on one or two great signature spaces, 4079 Kulamanu was created so that
  every room and space plays an important role in its narrative, defining a symphonic range of spatial emotions;
  from quiet, reflective spaces to charismatic areas for entertainment, clearly separated so that various occupants
  can enjoy them simultaneously. There are no ordinary spaces.</p>
            <p class = 'page-section'>Sketchtank sought to create as many openings as possible on the envelope walls and use similar materials for
  the interior and exterior to blur the division between inside and outside spaces, celebrating the Hawaiian
  concept of the lanai. The philosophy of Feng Shui heavily influenced the flow between rooms, as illustrated by
  how the expansive pool deck connects to the interior. Maximized openings in perimeter walls enhance the
  home’s relationship with the island.</p>

            <i class = 'caption page-section'>Motor court and guest house atop the 3-car garage</i>
            <p class = 'page-section'>The landscaping too speaks to the island. It was informed by the existing terrain and employs several changes
  in elevation to create compelling architectural topography. It defines an engaging path around the site
  punctuated by several key moments.</p>
            <p class = 'page-section'>A minimalist material palette punctuated by Alari’s rich Mother-of-pearl and capiz accents was chosen to allow
  the exterior views to be focal points, with specifications calling for a massive amount of imported travertine for
  floors and facades of the first level, complementing hand-applied Venetian finishes for exterior and interior
  walls.</p>
            <p class = 'page-section'>In the tradition of Frank Lloyd Wright, every element in the home is a puzzle piece in a perfectly balanced
  composition, and as such, this home is offered as a completely resolved design, with only minor allowances for
  client alterations, to be carried out with the design architect.</p>
            <br />
            <h2 class = 'page-section'>Location</h2>
            <p class = 'page-section'>4079 Kulamanu is located in <b>Black Point, Kahala</b>, Hawaii's most desirable residential neighborhood. Known as
  the island's luxury hideaway, it is conveniently situated near downtown Honolulu and Waikiki.</p>
